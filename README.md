# Grand-Challenge DICOM De-Identification Profile

This repository contains the profile for the [Grand-Challenge.org](https://www.grand-challenge.org) de-identification methods. The profile describes which action needs to be taken for a DICOM tag in order to be de-identified.

It is based on the DICOM Basic Profile of the [Standard DICOM de-identification profile](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part15/chapter_E.html#table_E.1-1) but customized for the use on the Grand-Challenge platform.

Changes are applied via a standard-operationg procedure (see below).
